									<h2>Excel Skills for Business Forecasting Specialization</h2>

									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/MAC3.jpg" alt=""></a>
									<p>Through the "Excel Skills for Business Forecasting" specialization, I learned how to apply advanced Excel techniques to develop accurate business forecasts. The specialization consisted of three courses - Time Series Models, Regression Models, and Judgmental Forecasting. In the Time Series Models course, I gained knowledge on how to understand different components underlying time series data sets and how to apply the relevant models to forecast business needs. The Regression Models course focused on building causal models for both time series and cross-sectional data, providing further business insights and strategy by controlling inputs to generate desired outputs. The final course, Judgmental Forecasting, introduced structured methodologies to create judgmental business forecasts, which are useful when quantitative forecasting methods have limitations. Throughout the specialization, I gained hands-on experience generating forecasts using Excel and learned how to utilize forecasting methods to make informed business decisions. I am confident in my ability to apply these forecasting skills to real-world business problems and add value to organizations that require advanced Excel skills in business forecasting.</p>
